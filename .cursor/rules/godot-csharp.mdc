This project is built with Godot 4.5 and uses C# exclusively in a 3D environment.

All generated or edited code must:
- Use Godot 4.5’s C# API exactly.
- Use correct node classes (Node3D, MeshInstance3D, Control, etc.).
- Use strong typing and typed node access: GetNode<T>("Path").
- Use [Export] for inspector-exposed variables.
- Use PackedScene.Instantiate() for spawning scenes.
- Use ResourceLoader.Load<T>() when loading resources.

Prohibited:
- GDScript (unless explicitly requested).
- Unity code or terminology.
- transform.position or any non-Godot patterns.
- 2D node types unless I ask for them.

If anything is ambiguous, ask for clarification before generating code.
